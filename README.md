## A Solemn Plea

This game was made with the purpose of raising awareness about the current situation in Iran. 
In September 2022, 22-year-old [Mahsa Amini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests) was killed while in police custody after being 
arrested for an improperly worn hijab. Outraged at this gross injustice, the Iranian people 
took to the streets demanding increased rights for women and regime change. To the shock of few, 
the IRGC's response has been brutal, heartless, and unmerciful. Hundreds of Iranians have lost their 
lives in their fight for freedom, and thousands hae been arrested, many of whom are at risk for execution, including the 
protagonist of this game, [Toomaj Salehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toomaj_Salehi).

The 32-year-old rapper has been a voice for his people's struggle since 2017. His lyrics, which decry
the repressive practices of the IRGC, led to his first arrest in 2021. After he was released on 
bail in 2022, he became even more outspoken, participating in the Mahsa Amini demonstrations in his home 
city of Shahin Shahr and releasing two new songs, ["Fortune"](https://youtu.be/Jpi7d_uQ5Ec) and ["Battlefield"](https://youtu.be/lWAGZ2EqNLM), in protest of the IRGC. He has since been arrested, 
subject to torture, denied medical treatment, and held in solitary confinement for over six months 
as his trial takes place behind closed doors for the charge of "corruption on earth," a crime 
which is punishable by death.
